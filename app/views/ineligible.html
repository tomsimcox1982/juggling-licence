        Sorry, we cannot issue you with a juggling licence
      </h1>

      <p>You need to be able to juggle at least 3 balls to be eligible for a juggling permit.</p>
      <p>The UK is a world leader in juggling and we want to protect this exemplary reputation. Therefore we cannot just issue licences to any old Tom, Dick or Harry.</p>

      <p>We suggest that you enrol in a <a href="https://juggling-academy.com/en/home/">Juggling Academy</a> course to improve your skills and apply again once you meet this criteria.</p>
